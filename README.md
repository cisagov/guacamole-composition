Creates a Docker composition containing instances of:

- [guacamole](https://hub.docker.com/r/guacamole/guacamole/) clientless
remote desktop gateway.
- [guacd](https://hub.docker.com/r/guacamole/guacd/) server-side proxy for
Guacamole.
- [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) relational database.
- [cisagov/guacscanner-docker](https://github.com/cisagov/guacscanner-docker)
  utility for continually scanning the EC2 instances in an AWS VPC and
  updating the Guacamole connections in the underlying PostgreSQL
  database.

## Running ##

A sample [Docker composition](docker-compose.yml) is included
in this repository.

To start the composition, use the command: `docker-compose up`

Connect to the Guacamole web interface at:
[http://localhost/guacamole](http://localhost/guacamole).

The default credentials are `guacadmin`, `guacadmin` - you should change those
as soon as possible.
